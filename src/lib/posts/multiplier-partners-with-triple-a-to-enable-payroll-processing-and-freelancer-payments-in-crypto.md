Empowering Freelancers to receive Cryptocurrency Payments



This partnership with Triple-A empowers Multiplier’s clients to offer payroll and freelancer payments in cryptocurrencies, without bearing any volatility risks of holding cryptocurrencies.



Employees and freelancers have the option to receive payments for their services in a wide range of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), and Tether (USDT). With crypto, freelancers no longer need to face complexities and delays often associated with traditional payment methods. Regardless of their location or the occurrence of bank holidays, they can receive their payments promptly and hassle-free.



This presents a significant opportunity to address the growing need for cryptocurrency payments among freelancers in key gig economy markets, including the Philippines. Notably, in the Philippines, a substantial portion of freelancers, over one-third, regularly receive crypto payments from their clients.
